# Efficient Superpermutation Construction (O(n) Space)
This repository contains the Java implementation of my O(n) space algorithm for constructing 
superpermutations, significantly improving upon previous O(n!) space methods (with some runtime improvements as well).

This approach allowed me to generate the n = 14 superpermutation (93.9 billion characters) 
in ~15 minutes on a personal computer. 

For full details and proofs see my paper:
